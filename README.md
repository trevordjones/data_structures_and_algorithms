I took UC San Diego's [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) specialization on Coursera, which is a series of courses in the topic of Computer Science.

This is a compilation of some of the algorithms/data structures that I imiplemented as part of earning these certificates.

The certifications I completed were:
- [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/Q5J483X3SU2B)
- [Algorithms on Strings](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/J3FVRE6ERD8N)
- [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/EJ9AU68J4VHQ)
- [Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/HR7P2M22M9UD)
