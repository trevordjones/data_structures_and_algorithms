"""
The Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform of a string permutes the symbols
so that it becomes more easily compressible. This is particularly
helpful with compressing genomes which have repeats. BWT can take
repeats (abcabcabc) and convert them to strings with more runs
(aaabbbccc) which can then be compressed (3a3b3c).
